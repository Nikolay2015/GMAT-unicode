This is NASA's General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT), adapted to make it Unicode-compliant.

The original was pulled from a svn checkout on August 30 from the official GMAT source tree
(http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/gmat).  There have been commits upstream since then.  As of now
(19 October 2011), I have made no effort to merge upstream changes into the current source tree, as
nearly every source file has been altered to some degree.  This builds on a 32-bit Fedora 15 install
with Unicode wxWidgets 2.8.  The build has not been tested for accuracy or stability.  Testing,
especially cross-platform testing, is encouraged.
